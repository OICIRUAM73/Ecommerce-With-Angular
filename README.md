# Store with Angular 8
A basic store app using Angular 8 and Firebase

# How it works

This is an example of a store. You can view products and add them to a cart and as an admin you can create, update and delete products

# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. We use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from [Here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

This project uses Firebase to login and register users. Replace `firebase` default values in the enviroment variables with the ones of your Firebase project.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
